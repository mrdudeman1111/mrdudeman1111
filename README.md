  Hello there, my name is Ethan, and I'm a 16 year old C/C#/C++ dev (as a hobby, not as a profession.). I'm experienced with UE4, UE5, unity, and blender.
 I've also been learning to use the Vulkan API, I've been working on a small wrapper for Vulkan recently. I've know glsl, hlsl, and I plan on learning about CGL (The shading language)
